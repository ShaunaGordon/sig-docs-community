# Docs & Community SIG meeting - YYYY-MM-DD

**Facilitator:** Roddie Kieley (@RoddieKieley)
**Notes taker:** Roddie Kieley (@RoddieKieley), Shauna Gordon (@ShaunaGordon)

[Agenda]()

## SIG Updates

- First recurring meeting of revived SIG group
- Naomi reported between meetings that Roddie has maintainer access, Shauna should have reviewer and can start going through process to gain maintainer
- Jan Hanca (@JanHanca) of Robotec joined in and called out his PR bringing dev into parity with main
- Reviewed repo settings to see how to lock down main so that no more commits go to it without going through dev/stabilization
- Shauna has Hugo experience and so can easily get docs spun up locally to test Jan's PR when it's ready


### Action items

- Roddie
    - double-check Shauna's reviewer perms, then other maintainer perms to prune maintainers
    - notify sig-docs-community list and discord about process change so everyone with merge to main perms knows what's going on
- Jan
    - update parity PR
- Shauna
    -  start reviewing and triaging PRs/Issues
    -  take point reviewing Jan's PR when ready
